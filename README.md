# Number Crunch - Version 2

This is the second version of Number Crunch, a two-player number guessing game with enhanced UI features. Players can select their fruit icons and enjoy a more compact, intuitive layout.

## Game Rules

1. Each player chooses a fruit icon and a secret 6-digit number with unique digits
2. Players take turns trying to guess each other's number
3. After each guess, the player receives feedback:
   - '+' for each digit in the correct position
   - '-' for each correct digit in the wrong position
4. Players have a customizable time limit per turn (30, 60, 90, or 120 seconds)
5. If time runs out, a default guess is submitted
6. The first player to correctly guess their opponent's number (getting '++++++') wins
